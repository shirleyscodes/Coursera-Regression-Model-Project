# Coursera Regression Model Project

Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

### Questions
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). 

They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

### Rules

Your report must be:

1. Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
2. Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. 
3. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. 
4. The appendix can only include figures.
3. Include a first paragraph executive summary.

## Peer Grading

The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.

1 - Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably).

2 - Your Course Project score will be the sum of the points and will count as 40% of your final grade in the course.
